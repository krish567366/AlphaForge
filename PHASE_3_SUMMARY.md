## 🚀 What Was Built

### 1. **Core Data Engine (Rust)**

- **File**: `crates/core/src/data_engine.rs`
- **Purpose**: High-performance market data processing orchestrator
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time tick processing with sub-microsecond latency
  - Multi-instrument bar aggregation (time, tick, volume, dollar-based)
  - Order book delta management
  - Comprehensive statistics tracking
  - Generic cache integration for optimal performance

### 2. **Market Data Types**

- **File**: `crates/core/src/data.rs`
- **Components**:
  - `TradeTick` - Trade execution data
  - `QuoteTick` - Bid/ask price updates  
  - `Bar` - OHLCV aggregated price bars
  - `BarType` & `BarSpecification` - Bar configuration
  - `BarAggregation` - Multiple aggregation methods

### 3. **Python Bindings (PyO3)**

- **File**: `crates/pyo3/src/data_engine.rs`
- **Purpose**: Expose high-performance Rust Data Engine to Python
- **Classes**:
  - `PyDataEngine` - Main processing engine
  - `PyDataEngineConfig` - Configuration management
  - `PyDataEngineStatistics` - Performance metrics
  - `PyTradeTick`, `PyQuoteTick`, `PyBar`, `PyBarType` - Data structures

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Data Processing Pipeline

```txt
Tick Input → Data Engine → Bar Aggregators → Statistics → Cache → Output
     ↓            ↓             ↓              ↓        ↓        ↓
TradeTick   Validation    Time/Volume/     Metrics   Fast     Bars/
QuoteTick   & Routing     Tick Counting    Update   Lookup    Stats
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Generic Cache Integration**: Leverages Phase 2 cache for sub-μs data access
2. **Enum-Based Aggregation**: Efficient bar type differentiation
3. **Zero-Copy Operations**: Minimal allocations in hot paths
4. **PyO3 Bindings**: Native Python integration without performance loss
5. **Modular Architecture**: Separate concerns for extensibility

## 🏗️ Integration Points

### Phase 2 Cache Integration

```rust
// Data Engine leverages generic cache for performance
impl DataEngine {
    fn get_recent_bars(&self, bar_type: &BarType, count: usize) -> Vec<Bar> {
        // Uses optimized cache lookup from Phase 2
        self.cache.get_bars(bar_type, count) 
    }
}
```

### Python Ecosystem Integration

```python
# Seamless Python integration
from alphaforge_pyo3.data import DataEngine, DataEngineConfig

config = DataEngineConfig(enable_statistics=True)
engine = DataEngine(config)
engine.start()

# Process market data
bars = engine.process_trade_tick(tick)
stats = engine.statistics()
```
